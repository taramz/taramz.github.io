        <h3> School Projects</h3>
        <p> This section highlights projects I have worked on during my time completing my masters degree. These projects showcase my skills in data analysis, simulation studies,
            webpage design, and model building.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://taramruthur.shinyapps.io/BlueBikes/">Blue Bikes</a>: Bike-share Usage in Boston (Summer 2022) is an RShiny app that allows users to look at 
                trends in usage for Blue Bikes, a Boston bike-share service, including station capacity and the number of unhappy customers in a day. Once the application is 
                launched, users can pick between three tabs: the main tab (for information on Blue Bikes), the summary statistics tab (to see visualizations on the data), and 
                the map simulations tab (to simulate bike-share usage throughout the day).</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/taramz/project_one">Effects of Smoking During Pregnancy on Adolescent Behavior</a>: This project aims to explore the effects of 
                smoking during pregnancy (SDP) and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure on adolescent self-regulation, substance use, and externalizing. The data used 
                from this project comes from two studies, one of which was published in 2016. The data has not been made publicly available, but the information provided in 
                this documentation will provide a thorough explanation of the data, while respecting data privacy. The code for this project will be provided, as well as 
                summary tables that allow some insight into the data used.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/taramz/project_two">Predicting Likelihood of Receiving a Tracheostomy</a>: This study utilizes a national dataset of 996 infants 
                with severe Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (sBPD) from 10 centers, focusing on demographics, diagnostics, and respiratory parameters at 36 and 44 weeks 
                post-menstrual age to predict if an infant should receive a tracheostomy. Concerns arise from a disproportionate center representation, potential biases, 
                and notable tracheostomy percentage variations among centers. Variable selection identifies significant covariates, emphasizing prenatal corticosteroids, 
                small for gestational age (SGA), inspired O2, medication for pulmonary hypertension (PH), and invasive positive pressure. Correlation analyses guide the 
                exclusion of correlated metrics, and missing data patterns prompt careful imputation considerations. Fixed effects models and mixed-effects models, 
                acknowledging center-level variation, reveal consistent predictors in both 36 and 44-week models. Evaluation metrics favor the 44-week model, indicating 
                superior predictive accuracy, precision, and recall. Surprisingly, the addition of a random intercept for center minimally affects model performance on 
                validation data, suggesting limited center-level variation. This study emphasizes the complexity of predicting tracheostomy in sBPD infants, providing 
                direction for future predictive models for tracheostomy.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/taramz/project_three">Simulations and Transportability Analysis</a>: 
                Empirical research often involves two distinct populations—the study and target populations—posing challenges for predictive model development due to 
                potential discrepancies between them. Using data from the Framingham Study and NHANES, this investigation explores cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction 
                across diverse populations. While Framingham focuses on long-term CVD epidemiology, NHANES assesses the health of the U.S. population, highlighting population 
                differences that complicate model generalizability. Transportability analysis, guided by the ADEMP framework and measured using the Brier score, evaluates 
                model performance across datasets. Gender-specific simulations and multiple imputation address data gaps, revealing nuanced biases and disparities in 
                performance, particularly between men and women, with limitations in data generation and computational constraints pointing to areas for further refinement.</li>

        <h3> Masters Thesis</h3>
        <p> This section provides information on my masters thesis: a project spanning the second year of my masters program. This project involved conducting a literature
            review, data pre-processing, model building, analysis of results, and finally, writing a paper. 
        </p>

        <h3><a href="https://repository.library.brown.edu/studio/item/bdr:e877ty9c/">Biologically Annotated Neural Networks for Case-Control Outcomes</a></h3>
        <p>This study introduces Biologically Annotated Neural Networks (BANNs) for identifying causal Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to complex traits. 
            BANNs combine neural network flexibility with Bayesian variable selection, featuring an architecture that leverages existing relationships between SNPs and 
            SNP-sets. Using a spike and slab prior, BANNs pinpoint relevant genetic variants, aiding interpretable inference of genetic effects. Parameter estimation employs 
            the Variational Expectation Maximization Algorithm, refining model fit iteratively. BANNs enables efficient computation of posterior inclusion probabilities, 
            offering insights into SNP relevance and enhancing model accuracy with both SNP and SNP-set level updates. Applied to the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium 
            (WTCCC) dataset, BANNs identify significant SNPs across seven diseases, validating known associations and revealing novel candidates like rs10914783's link to 
            coronary artery disease. While spike and slab priors yield sparse collections of posterior inclusion probabilities, most diseases in the dataset exhibit 
            significant p-values, indicating enrichment of BANN-identified gene-sets. Exceptions like hypertension and rheumatoid arthritis suggest potential factors like 
            fewer common risk alleles or misclassification bias. Overlaps among significant SNP-sets hint at shared biological pathways between diseases, warranting further 
            exploration. Notably, genes such as CSMD1 and PTPRD show significance across multiple diseases, emphasizing their potential role in disease susceptibility. 
            In conclusion, Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), exemplified by the WTCCC study, advance our comprehension of complex human diseases. Despite challenges 
            posed by complex genetic architectures, Bayesian variable selection methods, and interpretable machine learning techniques like BANNs, offer promising avenues 
            for enhancing precision medicine.</p>
